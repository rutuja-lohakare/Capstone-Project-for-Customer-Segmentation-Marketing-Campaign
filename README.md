# Capstone Project - Customer Segmentation (Marketing Campaign)

This repository is a Data Science Project in Python on Marketing Analytics. The Jupyter Notebook contains exploratory data analysis on a dataset. This analysis helps us to maximize the insight into a dataset and the underlying structure of a dataset while providing all the specific items that an analyst would want to extract from a dataset. The main motto is to segregate customers into different groups so that we can identify the different groups of customers coming into the event, or the different groups of customers coming into a mall and their spending behaviors. I have also performed K-Means Clustering on the dataset using Python.

Description : Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
